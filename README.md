# Face-Detection-with-C++
A Face Detection Program using C++ and OpenCV Open Source Computer Vision Library.

This C++ program is able to uses OpenCV's built-in face cascade classifier (haarcascade_frontalface_alt.xml) for face detection. 
Make sure you have this XML file available in the correct location. The code captures frames from the webcam, 
converts them to grayscale (which is required for face detection),
detects faces using the cascade classifier, and draws rectangles around the detected faces.
